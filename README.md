`flan_t5_x_imdb.py
`
#### **Description:**
This script fine-tunes the FLAN-T5 model on the IMDB dataset for sentiment
classification.
#### **How to Run:**
1. Install the necessary libraries:
pip install transformers datasets torch
2. Load the IMDB dataset and preprocess it for sentiment analysis.
3. Fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model using the training loop or a HuggingFace Trainer.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set and save the trained model.
### README for
`
gsm8k_x_flan_t5.py
